9)	Draw the anticipated currents and changes in membrane potential that will occur as a result of the previous three scenarios.

the "positive" and "negative" values for current and potential are the direction/sign of the post-synaptic potential curve


6.) 
Vm = -65 mV
ECl = -50 mV
Driving Force = -15 mV = Flows Outside
Post Synaptic Current = Negative
Post Synaptic Potential = Should Make It More Positive

7.) 
Driving Force = ( -65mV – ( -70 ) ) = 5 mV = Flows Inside
Post Synaptic Current = Positive
Post Synaptic Potential = Should Make It More Negative

8.) 
Driving Force ( -65mV – ( -65 ) ) = 0 mV = Zero NET Flow
Post Synaptic Current = 0
Post Synaptic Potential = No Action Potential



Driving Force = ( -40 mV – ( -70 mV ) ) = 30 mV = Flows Inside
Current = Positive
Potential = Negative

Driving Force = ( -65 mV – ( -70 mV ) ) = 5 mV = Flows Inside
Current = Positive
Potential = Negative

Driving Force = ( -70 mV – ( -70 mV ) ) = 0 mV = Zero Flow
Current = Zero
Potential = Zero

Driving Force = ( -80 mV – ( -70 mV ) ) = -10 mV = Flows Outside
Current = Negative
Potential = Positive

Driving Force = ( -100 mV – ( -70 mV ) ) = -30 mV = Flows Outside
Current = Negative
Potential = Positive
